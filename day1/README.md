# Day 1
Pretty straight forward today. These are the functions that I used:

`print` - This puts something into the terminal

`input` - Allows us to take an input from the user 

`len` - Allows us to calculate the length of a string

Note, I used an "F-string" to make the output a little easier and is a nice way to use format variables within strings.
