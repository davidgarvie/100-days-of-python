# Day 2
Lots of discussion of Mathemtic operaters here. Not too many suprises here but I hadn't seen `//` here which is the equivilant of floor division (e.g. will convert the result from a float to an int and round down). 

A few core concepts on data types:
- `string` - a sequence of characters
- `int` - A positive or negative whole number
- `float` - A floating point number (e.g. 3.14)
- `boolean` - True / False (note caps)

We can convert from type to another by using built in functions, for example: 

```py
int("3") // will convert the string "3" into an integer.
```
